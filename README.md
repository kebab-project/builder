# Requirements

## Mac OS X

1) Use [Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) for Lion (OS X 10.7) or Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).

2) Set zsh as your login shell:

    chsh -s /bin/zsh

## Linux

We currently support these distributions:

* [Ubuntu 14.04: Trusty Tahr](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseNotes),
* [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS: Precise Pangolin](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes),
* Debian stable (currently [wheezy](http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/)).
* Debian testing (currently [jessie](http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/)).

Also you can use distributions derived from up these. (Linux Mint, LMDE, Elementary, Pepper Mint, etc.)

(Note: LMDE 17 (Jessie based) and Elementary OS Luna (Precise Pangolin based) passed the test.)
